# SlotGame
## Overview/Synopsis
Creating this game was inspired by a few examples. The latest one that I looked at was here: https://www.vbtutor.net/VB_Sample/anislot.htm

I can't help but think there were better ways to handle some of the logic. I may add score and vertical lines as winning options. I included 5 shapes in order to lower the odds of winning. The shapes are 100% random using the Random().Next function.

## Potential Future Items
- Score
- Currency/Cost per spin and winnings
- Additional pay lines
- Additional/alternate shapes

## How to play
- To start the reels, run the executable and press the play button or click any shape (game stage area).
- You may click the stage or play button to stop one reel.
- The game will determine a winning line once all 3 reels are stopped.
- Winning lines are diagonals from corner to corner or horizontal lines.
